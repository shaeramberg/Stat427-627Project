# Part I: Exploratory Data Analysis

\newpage

## About the Data

Our data was obtained via UCI's Machine Learning Repository. The data is a multivariate set designed to explore student performance tied to various predictors during a collection period from 2005-2006. The data is split into two sets: Mathematics (student-mat.csv) and Portuguese (student-por.csv). These are the two subjects where records of student's attending two pubic school's from the Alentejo region of Portugal performance (our outcome *y*) were recorded. Predictor variables include a range of demographic, social, health, and school related attributes.

The data was utilized by a paper published in 2008 titled ["Using data mining to predict secondary school performance"](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Using-data-mining-to-predict-secondary-school-Cortez-Silva/61d468d5254730bbecf822c6b60d7d6595d9889c). The study's goal was to use BI/DM techniques to build a model that accurately predicted student performance given predictor variables that provided the best accuracy. Below, we will conduct an EDA exploring and cleaning this data set prior to conducting a replication of their study while critiquing their process and adding/removing anything we deem necessary to result in the best models for our given data and prior proposed research goal.

### Loading our Libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(car)
```

### Loading our Data

```{r}
# loading in both of our data sets, we will title them by their 
# subject
math <- read.csv("student-mat.csv", sep =  ";")
portuguese <- read.csv("student-por.csv", sep = ";") # our data was seperated by semi colons 
# instead of the traditional comma
```

\newpage

## Understanding the Data Structure

Prior to inspecting and cleaning our data, it is important we fully encapsulate what each column, row, and value mean.

```{r}
head(math)
head(portuguese)
```

Both of our data sets are structured the same with the same column and row variables as well as structured values. This will help make implementing any cleaning and modeling simpler.

### Variables & Values

Referring back to the original paper, there are 33 columns of interest. Those variables are listed below alongside their values, with explanation and clarification as needed, below:

**For a visual example, I have printed a random row to show how the values are presented as they are explained below**

`health` - Leveled integer values scaled from 1-5 of a students health status, `1` being bad and `5` being very good.

`absences` - Numeric values of the number of day absences the student has from the course so far, i.e. a value of `5` would mean the student has been absent from the class a total of 5 times.

`G1` - Leveled integer values scaled from 0-20 of a students first period grade in the course(period is a trimester in American equivalency).

`G2` - Leveled integer values scaled from 0-20 of a students second period grade in the course.

`G3` - Leveled integer values scaled from 0-20 of a students third period grade in the course.

### Classes & Values

Given the review of our variables and their values, we should expect (was gonna explain what classes i expect them to be and also suggest changing the G1-G3 to numeric values so we can use them unleveled)

```{r}
str(math)
str(portuguese)
```

This gives us a general idea of what each column look, and the class which is all integers and character columns.

### Cleaning Up

```{r}
sum(is.na(math))
sum(is.na(portuguese))
```

The original data from the survey was processed and certain variables were excluded by the author of the paper due to lack of discriminative value. To verify that our data sets are clean, we check to see if there are any missing values.

Our general approach to this project involves replicating some of the models used in the paper. The paper would predict student success using the G3 score, in one of three forums: binary classification, classification with five levels, and regression on the 0-20 scale. To ease the replication process we will create two new columns to represent the forum we want our output to be in:

```{r}
math <- math |> 
  mutate(five_level=case_when(
    G3 > 15 ~ "I",
    G3 >= 14 ~ "II",
    G3 >=12 ~ "III",
    G3 >=10  ~ "IV",
    G3 < 10 ~ "V"
  )) |> 
    mutate(pass_fail=case_when(
      G3>=10 ~ "Pass",
      G3<10 ~ "Fail"
    )) -> math2


portuguese <- portuguese |> 
  mutate(five_level=case_when(
    G3 > 15 ~ "I",
    G3 >= 14 ~ "II",
    G3 >=12 ~ "III",
    G3 >=10  ~ "IV",
    G3 < 10 ~ "V"
  )) |> 
    mutate(pass_fail=case_when(
      G3>=10 ~ "Pass",
      G3<10 ~ "Fail"
    )) -> portuguese2

math2$five_level<-factor(math2$five_level)
portuguese2$five_level<-factor(portuguese2$five_level)

portuguese2 <- portuguese2 %>%
  mutate(across(c(pass_fail, romantic, internet, higher, nursery, activities, paid, famsup, schoolsup, guardian, reason, Fjob, Mjob, school, address, famsize, Pstatus, sex), as.factor))
```

## Correlations & Distribution

### Means & Distributions

Here we exam visual distributions

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data=math2, aes(x=five_level))+
  geom_bar() +
  ggtitle(paste("Mean:", round(mean(
    as.numeric(math2$five_level)), 2))) +
  labs(subtitle = "Math: Five-Levels")

ggplot(data=portuguese2, aes(x=five_level))+
  geom_bar() + 
  ggtitle(paste("Mean:", round(mean(
    as.numeric(portuguese2$five_level)), 2))) +
  labs(subtitle = "Portuguese: Five-Levels")

ggplot(data=portuguese2, aes(x=pass_fail))+
  geom_bar() +
  labs(subtitle = "Portuguese: Pass-Fail")

ggplot(data=math2, aes(x=pass_fail))+
  geom_bar() +
  labs(subtitle = "Math: Pass-Fail")

ggplot(data=portuguese2, aes(x=G3))+
  geom_bar() + 
  ggtitle(paste("Mean:", round(mean(
    as.numeric(portuguese2$G3)), 2))) +
  labs(subtitle = "Portuguese: G3")

ggplot(data=math2, aes(x=G3))+
  geom_bar() + 
  ggtitle(paste("Mean:", round(mean(
    as.numeric(math2$G3)), 2))) +
  labs(subtitle = "Math: G3")
```

### Correlations & Plots

```{r}
ggplot(data=math2, aes(x=G3, y=G2))+
  geom_point()+
  labs(title="Math final scores with G2 scores")
```

Clear correlation between second period grades and final grade, shows the in-balance of models that use G2 as a predictor vs those that don't. We will dive into collinearity assumptions with tests in the statistical analysis section.

\newpage

## Statistical Analysis

Its important to note any patterns or anomalies with our data. We will look at possible outliers and quickly summarize G3 (our predicted variable).

```{r}
summary(portuguese2$G3)
sd(portuguese2$G3)

summary(math2$G3)
sd(math2$G3)
```

It seems most students pass, with math scores being slightly lower on average.

```{r}
ggplot(portuguese2, aes(y=G3)) + geom_boxplot()

ggplot(math2, aes(y=G3)) + geom_boxplot()
```

It seems our Portuguese course has two values that are outliers, but we will not remove them as values due to their predictive ability for students who may fail a class. Also, tree-based models are not affected by outliers.

There are a few ways to test for collinearity with variables: VIF, visualization on a scatter plot, or using a pairwise approach and testing its correlation.

```{r}
# testing using VIF
lm_for_VIF <- lm(G3 ~ G1 + G2, data=portuguese2)

vif(lm_for_VIF)
```

A VIF score of 1 is typically indicates no correlation with other predictors. A VIF of 10 is generally considered too high. However, its also important to consider what kind of model we are creating. We are creating prediction models, so we would consider a value of about \~3.97 to be relatively moderate. Essentially, utilization of both predictors G1 and G2 in our model is not likely to cause issues with predicting our outcome, G3.

```{r}
grades <- portuguese2[, c("G1", "G2", "G3")]

cor_matrix <- cor(grades, use = "complete.obs")
print(cor_matrix)
```

However, now that we have run a correlation matrix, it is displaying very strong correlation between our variables G1, G2, and G3. This confirms high collinearity among them, which would cause an increase in standard errors in our regression models.

## Exploratory Graphs

```{r}

ggplot(data=portuguese2, aes(x=as.factor(failures), y=G3))+
  geom_boxplot()
ggplot(data=portuguese2, aes(x=as.factor(Dalc), y=G3))+
  geom_boxplot()
ggplot(data=portuguese2, aes(x=as.factor(studytime), y=G3))+
  geom_boxplot()
```

We wanted to look at the relationship between some predictor variables that we thought may have a strong relationship to G3 final grades. We do see small correlations like lower grades as alcohol consumption increases, and higher grades as study time increases.

### Review of Plan to fit Models

Our general approach to this project will be to recreate many of the models created in the [paper](https://repositorium.uminho.pt/server/api/core/bitstreams/991a0e2b-249d-466d-afef-937d975ff7fc/content) connected with this data set. In the paper, the classification/regression methods tried to predict G3 (passing/failing Portuguese and Math) in 3 supervised approaches:

-   Binary (Pass/Fail) - Pass is considered `G3`\>/=10; else is Fail

-   5-level Classification

-   Regression (as is current `G3` column, scale 0-20)

The data was then modeled using 5 data mining algorithm:

-   Neural Networks (NN) - E = 100 training epochs utilizing BFGS algorithm

-   Support Vector Machines (SVM) - SMO algorithm utilized

-   Decision Trees (DT) - node splitting utilized to reduce sum of squares

-   Random Forest (RF) - default parameters, T = 500

-   Naive Predictor (NV) - (1) baseline of G3 = G2, (2) G3 = G1, (3) most common class or mean

These 4 DM's were compared against the baseline naive predictor (NV) model. Additionally it was noted that 20 runs of 10-fold cross validation were applied to each configuration.

Each model was run with each of 3 input setups. The setups included (A), all variables minus G3, (B) all variables minus G2 and G3, and (C) neither G2, G3, or G1. This means that model (A) is utilizing the prediction power of G1 and G2 grades in their model for accurate prediction of G3 grades, where setup (B) utilizes solely G1 grades to predict G3, and setup (C) uses none of the trimester grades as a predictor for G3.

The reason the authors made this decision was due to the likelihood of high collinearity between G1, G2, and G3. The usage of Naive Predictors as three input configurations is to account for this potential (and likely) collinearity.

Furthermore, more pre-processing was established with nominal variables as well. The authors decided to transform them into a *1-of-C* encoding with all attributes being standardized to a 0 mean and a one standard deviation.

\newpage

## Modeling Procedures

According to the paper that we are replicating, their goal was to "give a simple description that summarizes the best DM models". The authors used this model as it was collected, essentially creating a model that could be used to predict student outcomes once the student was in their third trimester of the class. We intend to work with the same desired prediction and usage of the variables.

In order to differentiate our model from theirs while still replicating part of the study, we wish to take the approach that the model is used prior to a students choice to enroll in a class. Essentially, our model see's to predict a students outcome in the class using variables that are known prior and during class enrollment so that a user could predict their grade before the third trimester.

We understand the choice of the authors to use an A-B-C subset method, however, given time constraint, we decided to solely select subset (A). Inclusion of G1 and G2 would indicate a model that can predict a students grade for trimester 3 while considering trimester 1 and 2.

We will prioritize replicating two of their original models - Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF). However, we plan to add three of our models: Partial Least Squares (PLS), LASSO Regression (LR), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). PLS and LR will use continuous 1-20 outcomes while our LDA would utilize the binary (pass/fail) outcome. We will also add a simple Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) as a baseline model. All of such will be used to predict outcomes for the Portuguese course (which has more observations, 649 v. 395) for time constraint, and only reproduce models with input A, as we want to view prediction power with the utilization of G1 and G2 grades.

Note on data splitting:

The paper states: "To access the predictive performances, 20 runs of a 10- fold cross-validation (Hastie et al. 2001) (in a total of 200 simulations) were applied to each configuration. Under such scheme, for a given run the data is randomly divided in 10 subsets of equal size. Sequentially, one different subset is tested (with 10% of the data) and the remaining data used to fit the DM technique. At the end of this process, the evaluated test set contains the whole dataset, although 10 variations of the same DM model are used to create the predictions."

To replicate the data we will not do an initial 20-80 split but run the 10-fold cross-validation on our models. This comes out to about 10% of the data utilized per fold, so 90% of our data will be used to train the models, and 10% will be used to test the data.

In summary, we intend to replicate this study, with key differences: we intend to use solely setup (C), we intend to replicate Decision Tree and Random Forest from the original paper but replace the other models with Partial Least Squares, Lasso and LDA, and examine solely the Portuguese course data for time constraint reasons.

# Part 2: Model Fitting

## Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) - continuous 1-20

Prior to evaluating the performance of our models, we decided to create a "dummy" model for baseline comparison to efficiently evaluate the performance of our more complex models, such as Decision Tree or Random Forest models. While complex models provide deeper analysis on feature interactions and non-linearity considerations, they can be prone to over-fitting and require more computation and steps, which may lead to mistakes on our part. In order to prevent and check for mistakes such as these, we are creating this baseline model to compare performance, to assure our complex models are not performing *drastically* different.

Below is our model, followed by assumptions to assure reliability.

```{r}
library(mgcv)
# we decided on a 90-10 split
set.seed(627)
train.pct <- 0.9
Z <- sample(nrow(portuguese2), floor(train.pct*nrow(portuguese2)))
portuguese.data <- portuguese2[Z, ]
holdout.data <- portuguese2[-Z, ]
# remember we are removing pass_fail and five_level since those are for categorical outcomes
MLR <- lm(G3 ~ . -five_level -pass_fail, data = portuguese.data) 
```

Lets check and see how it is performing:

```{r}
summary(MLR)
```

Our model is showing an R squared of .8594, so our model is covering 86% of the variance in G3. This is relatively good. Our p-value indicates a significant model, lets check for MSE.

```{r}
predicted_MLR <- predict(MLR, newdata = portuguese.data)

mean((predicted_MLR - portuguese.data$G3)^2)
min(portuguese.data$G3)
max(portuguese.data$G3)
```

The MSE for this model was \~1.52, which decently accurate. Within range of knowing the difference of a students passing or failing a class. If a student wanted strategic accuracy, a 1.5 difference in score prediction is reliable.

####ATTEMPT 2######\
(Using just the Binary Outcome and we will replicate Input C where we keep G1 and G2)

Re-do the below LR using PCA

## Logistic Regression (LR) - Binary Outcome

Below is our model, followed by assumptions to assure reliability.

```{r}
# remember we are removing G3 and five_level since those are for other outcomes

# changing pass to 1 and fail to 0
library(dplyr)

portuguese_pass_fail <- portuguese.data |>
  mutate(pass_fail = ifelse(pass_fail == "Pass", 1, 0))

LR <- glm(pass_fail ~ . -five_level -G3, data = portuguese_pass_fail, 
          family = binomial) 
```

Lets check and see how it is performing:

```{r}
summary(LR)
```

Our model is showing an residual deviance of 132.68, so our model is covering a large portion of the variance in pass_fail. This is good. Our AIC indicates a good fit.

### Model 2: Step-wise AIC

### Model 3: Decision Tree

```{r}
library(tree)
tree_initial<-tree(pass_fail ~ . -G3-five_level, data=portuguese.data)
summary(tree_initial)
pred_val<-predict(tree_initial, newdata=holdout.data, type="class")
table(pred_val, holdout.data$pass_fail)
mis.class<-mean(pred_val != holdout.data$pass_fail)
mis.class
```

Our initial tree model had a misclassification rate of around 10.8% on our testing data. We will tune it to see if that can be improved.

Tuning tree:

```{r}
set.seed(627)
cv.tree.model<- cv.tree(tree_initial, FUN=prune.misclass, K=10)
cv.tree.model
plot(cv.tree.model$size, cv.tree.model$dev, type="b")
tuned_tree<-prune.misclass(tree_initial, best=3)
plot(tuned_tree)
text(tuned_tree, pretty=0)
pred_val2<-predict(tuned_tree, newdata=holdout.data, type="class")
table(pred_val2, holdout.data$pass_fail)
mis.class2<-mean(pred_val2 != holdout.data$pass_fail)
mis.class2

```

Tuning the tree brings our misclassification rate down to 7.7% which is better, but the model is very inflexible now.

## Previous Failed Attempt (remove later):

Recall we are only creating models to predict outcomes of portuguese and will not use G1 or G2 as predictors due to the clear prediction power of the variable and the colinearity. We will also be replicating the paper by using 20 runs of 10-fold cross-validation.

```{r}
#library(rminer)
#portuguese2$pass_fail<-as.factor(portuguese2$pass_fail)

#K<-c("kfold", 10)
#DT<-mining(pass_fail~.-G1-G2-G3-five_level , data=portuguese2, model="dt", Runs=20, method=K)
#print(mean(DT$error))
#savemining(DT,"DT-results")

```

This below was just trying to make more of them categorical, it doesn't seem to make a good difference in the outcome though so probably delete later.

```{r}
#portuguese3 <- portuguese2 %>%
#  mutate(across(c(pass_fail, romantic, internet, higher, nursery, activities, paid, famsup, schoolsup, guardian, reason, Fjob, Mjob, school, address, famsize, Pstatus, sex, freetime, goout, Walc, Dalc, health), as.factor))
```

```{r}
#rpart(pass_fail~.-G1-G2-G3-five_level , data=portuguese2, model="rpart")
```
